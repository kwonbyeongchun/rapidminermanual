Firstly, because humans are famously better at understanding examples about other humans. And secondly, because each enterprise proba bly has information, i.e. attributes, regarding their customers and most readers can therefore relate to the examples immediately. The attributes available as a minimum, which just about every enterprise keeps about its customers, are for example geographical data and information as to which products or services the customer has already purchased. You would be surprised what forecasts can be made even from such a small amount of attributes. "
