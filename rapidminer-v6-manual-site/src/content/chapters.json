If your process contains intermediate results which are not (or no longer) indicated in the Results Perspective, you can also store these from the Process View. In order to do this, click on a port where data is present using the right-hand mouse button. This is the case at the output ports of all operators that have already been executed. You will recognise this from the darker colour and an appropriate entry in the context help. You select the menu entry “Store in Repository” here to store the object. Please bear in mind however that the data at the ports may be released again after some time in order to save memory and is therefore not guaranteed to stay at the ports for any amount of time. Please also see the explanations in the previous chapter."

For this reason we would like to remind you of and underline the necessity of using the repository for data and process management in order to provide support during process design. In this section we will carry out a further example for the design of a process, only this time we will revert to a data set from the RapidMiner Sudio repository.

Of course, this process would typically be preceded by importing data into the repository using one of the methods presented above, but in this case we shall skip this step and simply use one of the data sets already provided by RapidMiner Studio instead. Load for example the provided data set Iris using a retrieve operator, by simply dragging the entry concerned (in the same directory as the golf data set already used above) into the Process View. Do not execute the process yet though. Insert a normalise operator and connect its input with the output of the retrieve opera- tor. Set the parameter “method” to “range transformation”. In this setting, the operator serves for re-scaling numerical values so that the minimum is currently 0 and the maximum is currently 1. Select an individual attribute which you wish to apply this transformation to, e.g. the attribute “a3”. For this purpose, set the filter type “attribute filter type” to “single” and select the attribute “a3” at the parameter “attribute”. Now go over the output port of retrieve first with the mouse and then over the upper output port of the normalise operator. In both cases you will see the meta data of the Iris data set. You will notice however that the meta data of the selected attribute have changed: The range of values of “a3” is now normalised to the interval [0,1] after the transformation.
