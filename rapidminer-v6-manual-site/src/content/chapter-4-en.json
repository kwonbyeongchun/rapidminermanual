Moving Columns You can change the order of columns in most tables by clicking on the column heading and dragging the column to a new position while holding down the mouse button. This can be practical if you wish to compare the contents of two columns with one another in large tables. Adjusting Column Widths You can adjust the width of columns by holding the cursor over the area between two columns and changing the width of the column to the left of the separation"
